# 📊 Acko Health Insurance: Data-Driven Insurance Premium Pricing Strategy

## 📝 Problem Statement
Acko, a digital insurance provider, is launching a new health insurance product and requires a data-driven approach to determine the optimal insurance premium pricing for different customer segments.

Since no direct health insurance data is available (such as medical history, hospital visits, or past health insurance claims), the analysis will rely on demographic, financial, and health-related behavioral indicators to estimate risk levels and pricing.

### 🔍 Project Goal
The goal is to develop a structured, rule-based pricing model that balances:

- **Profitability** – Ensuring premiums are structured based on risk-adjusted factors.
- **Affordability** – Ensuring premiums align with customers' financial capacity and risk exposure.

## 🎯 Key Goal for Acko
To determine an optimal premium pricing strategy that balances business profitability with customer affordability, leveraging available demographic, financial, and behavioral data.

### 📌 Primary Objective
Develop a **rule-based logical formula** to calculate the **final premium price** for each customer based on their **demographic, risk, and affordability profile**.
